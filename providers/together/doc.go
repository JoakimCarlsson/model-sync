// Package together parses Together AI's model catalog into the catalog model.
//
// Together is a host rather than a lab: it serves other people's models, so
// every entry carries the organization that made it and an API string that is
// a path rather than a name. It publishes one page holding eight tables of
// eight different shapes, one per modality, and the shape is the only thing
// saying what a rate means. An image model is priced per megapixel with a
// default step count, a video model per video at a fixed resolution and
// duration, an audio model per million characters or per minute of audio
// depending on which direction it runs, and an embedding model per million
// tokens beside the width of the vector it returns.
